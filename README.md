Logistic and Linear Regression
Module 3:
Case Study 1: 
Heart Disease Classification using Logistic Regression
Train a Logistic Regression model to classify which patients are most likely to suffer from heart disease in the near future.
Dataset: Use the features given in the heart-disease.csv dataset.
Approach:
•	Import the dataset and do the necessary pre-processing.
•	Build a Logistic Regression model to classify a person as having heart disease or not.
•	Evaluate the model using
o	Confusion matrix
o	Classification Report
o	Accuracy

Case Study 2: 
Application of Linear Regression for Housing Price Prediction
Develop a Linear Regression model for predicting the housing price based on certain factors like house area, bedrooms, furnished, nearness to mainroad, etc.
Dataset: house_price.csv
Approach:
•	Import the dataset and do the necessary pre-processing.
•	Develop a Linear Regression model to predict prices.
•	Evaluate the model using
o	R2 score
o	RMSE
